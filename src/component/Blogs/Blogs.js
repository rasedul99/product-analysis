      <h2>what is context api </h2>
      <p>
        The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce
        global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to
        "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and
        so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state
        management using Redux.

      <h2>what are semantic tags in html?</h2>
      <p>
        What is a semantic tag in HTML? Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML
        that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation.
        For example, a tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This
        is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs
        are, and browsers know how to display them.
      </p>
