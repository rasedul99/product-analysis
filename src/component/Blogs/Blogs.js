      <h2>what is context api </h2>
      <p>
        The Context API is a React structure that enables you to exchange unique
        details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of your
        application.

      <h2>what are semantic tags in html?</h2>
      <p>
        Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the
        web page rather than just presentation. For example, a tag indicates
        that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and
        presentational because people know what paragraphs are, and browsers
        know how to display them.
      </p>
